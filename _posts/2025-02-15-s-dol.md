\*The near future.\* It’s not a kiss, but it’s not _not_ a kiss. Her lips—full, soft, pliable—yield under mine, warm from the electric heating rod embedded in her throat. They taste of a faint chemical, like aspartame in Diet Pepsi.

Her thermoplastic elastomer skin is sensitive to fabric dyes, so she wears white Agent Provocateur lingerie on white Ralph Lauren sateen sheets. I’ve prepped her body with Estée Lauder talcum, a detail I take pride in, to mimic the dry elasticity of real flesh. Her breathing quickens—a quiet pulse courtesy of Dyson Air technology. Beneath the TPE skin, her Boston Dynamics joint system gyrates softly. She’s in silent mode, so when I kiss her neck, her moan streams directly into my Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth headphones.[My sex doll is mad at me: A fiction story - MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/02/14/1111382/robots-sex-doll-relationships-fiction-speculation-customer-service/) _Leo Herrera is a writer and artist.
